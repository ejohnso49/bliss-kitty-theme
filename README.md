# bliss-kitty-theme
A port of the Bliss Theme for iTerm2 by @joshjon

## Installation

Copy `bliss.conf` to your `kitty` themes configuration directory

```shell

# Default kitty config dir on Linux is ~/.config/kitty/themes
$ cp bliss.conf ~/.config/kitty/themes
# Select Bliss with kitten theme, kitty will take care of the rest
$ kitten theme

```

## TODO

- Fix slightly incorrect colors, in `kitty`.
  Everything looks slightly off, strangely Vim looks better
